# Group G01 PDS Project: Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Group G01 PDS project focused on building a Movie Recommendation System. The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Movie Dataset, visualizing movie statistics, calculating similarity based on user ratings, and interpreting user reviews based on genre.

## Project Overview
In this project, our goal is to create a Movie Recommendation System using a Movie Dataset as reference. We will analyze user ratings, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), generate visualizations for movie statistics, calculate similarity between user ratings, and provide insights into user reviews based on movie genres.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Movie Dataset. It contains information about various movies, including details like movie title, genre, release year, user ratings, and reviews. This dataset forms the foundation for our analysis and recommendation system.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights into the dataset, we will conduct EDA. This step involves exploring various aspects of the data, such as movie genre distribution, release year trends, and user engagement.

## Visualizations
We will create visualizations to better understand the dataset's characteristics:
- **Most Viewed Movies:** Visual representation of the movies with the highest view counts.
- **Movie Ratings Distribution:** Visualization depicting the distribution of user ratings.
- **Genre Analysis:** Insights into user preferences through genre-based visualizations.

## User Ratings Similarity
To enhance the accuracy of our recommendation system, we will calculate similarity between user ratings. This will help us identify users with similar tastes and recommend movies accordingly.

## Interpreting User Reviews
Understanding user reviews based on movie genres is another crucial aspect of our analysis. By aggregating and analyzing reviews for different genres, we aim to uncover patterns and preferences among users.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd repo-name`
3. Run the recommendation system script: `python recommend_movies.py`
